### AI in Early Diabetes Detection [https://github.com/gina-occhipinti/analytics-symposium-diabetes-prediction] - Symposium and Conference Project
My partner and I built a predictive model to assess the likelihood of Type 2 Diabetes using health and lifestyle factors. The project involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and training classification models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) to evaluate risk. We presented our findings at the annual Analytics & Industry Symposium as well as an AI in healthcare conference, focusing on model interpretability and real world healthcare applications.

### Spotify Recommendation System - Final Capstone Project 

This final capstone project builds a recommendation system using Spotify playlist data and audio features like BPM, energy, popularity and genre. To go beyond traditional filtering, we used FastText (by Meta) to embed song lyrics and capture the semantic meaning behind them. This allows the system to recommend songs that aren’t just musically similar but also lyrically relevant - for example, suggesting another emotionally intense breakup song if that’s what the user likes. The model blends these text based embeddings with numerical features to deliver more personalized, context aware music recommendations.
