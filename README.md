# collaboration-projects
A collection of repositories and projects I’ve contributed to, with context and links to my work. 
Highlights include:

- AI for Early Detection of Diabetes – a symposium project focused on applying machine learning for healthcare insights.
- Spotify Recommendation System – my final capstone project, improving song recommendations using data-driven modeling.

### AI in Early Diabetes Detection [https://github.com/gina-occhipinti/analytics-symposium-diabetes-prediction] - Symposium and Conference Project
My partner and I built a predictive model to assess the likelihood of Type 2 Diabetes using health and lifestyle factors. The project involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and training classification models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) to evaluate risk. We presented our findings at the annual Analytics & Industry Symposium as well as an AI in healthcare conference, focusing on model interpretability and real world healthcare applications.

### Spotify Recommendation System [https://github.com/jmetz1313/spotify-project] - Final Capstone Project 

Built a recommendation system using Spotify playlist data and audio features like BPM, energy, popularity, and genre. To go beyond traditional filtering, I used FastText (by Meta) to embed song lyrics and capture their semantic meaning. This allowed the system to recommend songs that weren’t just musically similar, but also lyrically relevant - for example, suggesting another emotionally intense breakup song if that’s what the user likes. The model blends these text-based embeddings with numerical features to deliver personalized, context-aware music recommendations.
